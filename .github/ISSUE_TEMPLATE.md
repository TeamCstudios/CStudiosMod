1) What version of the mod are you using (please check the Mods menu provided by forge).


2) Screenshots/Videos showing the bug. The *entire* minecraft/web browser screen is needed. Feel free to cover any info you don't want revealed. Usually only a screenshot is needed and no other info is needed, but fill out the rest anyway.


3) _Brief_ explaination of the bug. I want it brief, if you can describe the issue to your dad without him being confused, it's more than enough for me.


4) Steps to reproduce the bug (i.e. how you got the bug)
